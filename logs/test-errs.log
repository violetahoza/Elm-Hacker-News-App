I was expecting to see a closing parenthesis next:

119|         filteredPosts = List.filter ( \post -> (configuration.showJobs && post.type_ == "job") 
120|                                                 || (configuration.showTextOnly && post.url /= Nothing)
                                                                                                           ^
Try adding a ) to see if that helps!

Note: I can get confused by indentation in cases like this, so maybe you have a
closing parenthesis but it is not indented enough?

`elm make` failed with exit code 1.
